db8 Social Media Share version 1.1
for Joomla 3.2

Most Social Media extensions had too much options for me. 
So I created a small social media share module with only the functionality that I needed.

Version 1.1 has 6 icons for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Email and Pinterest.
The icon images have been replaced with icomoon icons made with http://icomoon.io/app/

You can configure the order of the buttons and visibility (order "0" = invisible). When a visitor clicks on one of the buttons, it opens a small window where the visitor can change the text with link to your page.

It does not use JavaScript, nor does it communicate any information to the social media websites if the buttons are not clicked.
