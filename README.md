db8 Social Media Share
for Joomla 3.2

Most Social Media extensions had too much options for me. 
So I created a small social media share module with only 
the functionality that I needed.

It has 4 icons for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+.
You can configure the order of the buttons and visibility 
(order "0" = invisible). When a visitor clicks on one of 
the buttons, it opens a small window where the visitor can 
change the text with link to your page.

It does not use JavaScript, nor does it communicate any 
information to the social media websites if the buttons 
are not clicked.
